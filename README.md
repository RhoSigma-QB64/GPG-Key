# RhoSigma's GPG-Key
This repository contains my **OpenPGP/GnuPG/Gpg4Win** compatible public key, which I use here at GitHub and in the Forum/Discord of the [QB64 Phoenix Edition](https://www.qb64phoenix.com/) to sign my released files and archives.

Adding this key to your keyring and once approving its validity by signing the key with your own one enables you to easily check the authenticity of my releases by checking the provided signatures.

#### Download the key right here ([RhoSigma_public.asc](https://github.com/RhoSigma-QB64/GPG-Key/raw/main/RhoSigma_public.asc)) or grab it from the repository.

>You may have to right click the link above and choose `Save target as...` from the context menu. Additionally I've also published the key to the Ubuntu keyserver (hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com), so the software can also automatically grab the key from there.
